        <h1>SCOPE AFTER B.PHARM</h1>
        <p><b>After earning the B.Pharm degree, candidates can opt for a wide range of professional or study paths. Some of the options those bachelors of pharmacy candidates usually choose from include: </b></p>

Additionally, they offer support to the technical team whenever needed. </p><h3>CLINICAL RESEARCHER: </h3>
        <p>The role of a clinical researcher is particularly suited for individuals possessing a B.Pharm degree with a keen eye for research and development. They conduct comprehensive clinical trials and research studies for establishing which pharmaceutical products are safe to use.

        <h3>PHARMACY MANAGER: </h3>
        <p>Pharmacy managers are responsible for managing all the daily operations of a pharmacy such as dispensing prescription medicines, guiding customers on the usage of medications and arranging product displays among others. Not just that, they handle drug inventory alongside maintaining the record of orders and ensuring the safety of stored products. Being the in-charge of a pharmaceutical facility, their work also involves training and supervising the staff. </p>
        <h3>MEDICAL WRITER: </h3>

        <h3>PUBLIC SECTOR OPTIONS: </h3>
        <p>Working in the public sector allows candidates to not only earn decent salaries but also avail additional benefits like housing allowance, travel allowance and several retirement benefits.
